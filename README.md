# Spectral Variability Augmented Two-Stream Network for Hyperspectral Sparse Unmixing

This set of files contains the code for SVATN published in the paper:
 "[Spectral Variability Augmented Two-Stream Network for Hyperspectral Sparse Unmixing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9919800)" 

The implementation of SVATN model is based on the SUnCNN (`SUnCNN: Sparse Unmixing Using Unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network').
